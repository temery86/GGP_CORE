intro "This survey is about family, work and everyday life. Our aim is to better understand, for example, what influences people's decision to have children or how they share household chores in couples. The results will be used to advise policy-makers on how to improve issues such a work-life balance, social relationships between generations and gender equality. Your participation is voluntary. If you don’t want to answer any of the questions as some of them deal with sensitive topics, you are free to skip these at any point. You can also withdraw at any time and we will ask you again at the end of the survey if you agree to submit your answers. We will remove all personal identifiers from the data and ensure that your answers are only accessed by authorized and verified researchers for scientific purposes."/ "Intro" : (Agree (1) "Agree to proceed")
