The aim is to study what factors influence family formation, having children, and relations between younger and older generations. Some of the questions are about your personal life and may be sensitive or difficult to answer but you can skip questions at any time if you don't want to answer. You can also withdraw at any time and we will ask you again at the end of the survey if you agree to submit your data.The study is part of an international programme co-ordinated by the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute and UN Economic Commission for Europe. Your participation is voluntary. We will remove all personal identifiers from the data and ensure that your answers are only accessed by authorized and verified researchers for scientific purposes.
